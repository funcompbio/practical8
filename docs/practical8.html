<h1 id="objectives">Objectives</h1>
<p>The learning objectives for this practical are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to perform implicit looping through lists.</li>
<li>Learn visualizing data in different ways.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="setup-and-background">Setup and background</h1>
<p>To do this practical you need an installation of R and RStudio. You can find the instructions in the <a href="/setup#r-and-rstudio">setup</a> link on how to install R and RStudio in your system. For a smooth development of this practical, it is strongly recommended that you follow and finish the previous <a href="/practical7/">practical 7</a>.</p>
<p>We will download some COVID19 data to illustrate the use of R and RStudio. Please follow the next two steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the Catalan Health Departament COVID19 data portal at <a href="https://dadescovid.cat">https://dadescovid.cat</a> and switch the language to “ENGLISH” using the pull-down menu on the top-right corner of the page.</li>
<li>Follow the downloads link and on the next page click and download the file corresponding to the “7 DAY AGGREGATION” for “CATALUNYA”. Make sure you know exactly where in your filesystem this file has been downloaded. <strong>Tip:</strong> some browsers automatically download files into a folder called “Downloads” or under a name corresponding to the translation of “Downloads” to the default language of your operating system.</li>
<li>Make a directory in your filesystem, for instance at your <em>home</em> directory, called <code>practical9</code> and copy in it the downloaded file.</li>
<li>Since the downloaded file is a ZIP file, uncompress as you did in <a href="/practical1/">practical 1</a> so that you finally have a file called <code>catalunya_setmanal.csv</code> in the directory <code>practical9</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are using the UPF <a href="https://myapps.upf.edu">myapps</a> cloud to run RStudio, then you need to either use an internet browser in <em>myapps</em> to download the data file directly in the <em>myapps</em> cloud or upload to the <em>myapps</em> cloud the file that you have downloaded in your own computer.</p>
<h1 id="lists-and-implicit-looping">Lists and implicit looping</h1>
<p>Lists allow one to group values through their elements. Let’s say we want to group the values of the risk of outbreak in the previous data, by the month in which the data belongs to. We can do that using the function <code>split()</code> to which we should give a first argument of the values we want to group and a second argument with the grouping factor.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; iepgbymonth &lt;- split(datg$IEPG_CONFIRMAT, mf)
&gt; class(iepgbymonth)

<p>Grouping values can be useful in data analysis when we want to examine the data separately by groups. Let’s say we want to visualize the distribution of values of the risk of outbreak for the month of April and June, next to each other. We can use the function <code>hist()</code> for that purpose, creating a grid of two plotting panes using the <code>par()</code> function, as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
&gt; hist(iepgbymonth$Apr, xlab=&quot;Risk of outbreak&quot;, main=&quot;April&quot;)
&gt; hist(iepgbymonth$Jun, xlab=&quot;Risk of outbreak&quot;, main=&quot;June&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="IEPGAprilJune.png" /></p>
<p>Now, let’s calculate the mean of the risk of outbreak for the month of April. Having built the previous <code>list</code> object, we can make that calculation applying the function <code>mean()</code> to the corresponding element of the list:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mean(iepgbymonth$Apr)
[1] 76.71023</code></pre>
<p>Let’s say we want to compare this value with the mean value for the month of March:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mean(iepgbymonth$Mar)
[1] NA</code></pre>
<p>Here we got an <code>NA</code> value because the month of March has missing values for some weeks and, by default, the function <code>mean()</code> propagates that <code>NA</code> value to the result. We can ask the <code>mean()</code> function to exclude <code>NA</code> values and do the calculation on the non-missing ones using the argument <code>na.rm=TRUE</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mean(iepgbymonth$Mar, na.rm=TRUE)
[1] 285.2916</code></pre>
<p>It would be tedious to do that calculation for each different month by writing one such function call for each element of the list. As an alternative, we could use a <code>while</code> or <code>for</code> loop that would iterate over the elements of the list. However, R provides a more compact way to iterating over lists, and other objects, by using functions for <em>implicit</em> <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Looping">looping</a> such as <code>lapply()</code> or <code>sapply()</code>. These functions take a list as a first argument, iterate through each element of that list, and at each iteration apply the function given in the second argument. Additional arguments can be given and will be passed to the <em>applied</em> function.</p>
<p>The function <code>lapply()</code> returns again the input list with its elements replaced by the result given by the function on each corresponding element, while the function <code>sapply()</code> attempts to simplify the resulting data structure in that if each element of the resulting list has length 1, then it return an atomic vector.</p>
<p>We can calculate the mean of the risk of outbreak per month with the following call to the <code>sapply()</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; sapply(iepgbymonth, mean, na.rm=TRUE)

      NaN 285.29158  76.71023  25.66524  20.77437 153.58826 190.42042 207.93477 
      Oct       Nov 
702.40661 607.29200 </code></pre>
<p>where here the argument <code>na.rm=TRUE</code> is passed by <code>sapply()</code> to each call to the <code>mean()</code> function. Try the same call using the <code>lapply()</code> function and notice the difference in the output.</p>
<p>Plot the distribution of the number of deaths (column <code>EXITUS</code>) per month in the general population (using box plots). Calculate the mean of the number of deaths per month in the general population and plot it over the previous box plots using the function <code>points()</code>. Check the help page of <code>points()</code> to find out how to use it, figure out how make the plotted point to be a solid diamond (<strong>hint:</strong> look at the argument <code>pch</code>).</p>
